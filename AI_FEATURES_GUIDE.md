For multiple choice questions, ensure distractors represent common misconceptions.

For fill-in-the-blank questions, accept common synonyms and abbreviations.
```

## üé® Question Types

### Multiple Choice
- **Automatic Validation**: Ensures correct answer is in options
- **Smart Distractors**: AI creates plausible wrong answers
- **Flexible Options**: 2-8 answer choices (4 default)
- **True/False Detection**: Auto-creates True/False for binary questions

### Fill in the Blank
- **Multiple Blanks**: Supports questions with multiple `_____` blanks
- **Case Insensitive**: Answers match regardless of capitalization
- **Multiple Acceptable Answers**: E.g., "apple", "apples", "red apple"
- **Smart Parsing**: AI detects blanks and provides variations

## üìä Structured Output

AI generates questions in a structured format:

```json
{
  "question": "What is the capital of France?",
  "question_type": "multiple_choice",
  "options": ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
  "correct_answer": "Paris",
  "acceptable_answers": ["Paris"],
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "tags": ["geography", "capitals"],
  "explanation": "Paris has been the capital of France since..."
}
```

## üîÑ Integration with Question Bank

Generated questions can be:
- **Added Individually**: Review and add each question separately

- **Filtered**: Only add questions that meet your standards
- **Edited**: Modify before adding to the bank

## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices

### For Text Input:
- Use well-structured educational content
- Include definitions, examples, and explanations
- Paste 2-3 paragraphs for best results
- Avoid very short or very long text blocks

### For Image Input:
- Use clear, high-resolution images
- Educational diagrams work best
- Include text, charts, or labeled diagrams
- Avoid blurry or handwritten content

### System Prompts:
- Test changes with small batches first
- Document what changes you made in descriptions
- Keep successful prompts for future reference
- Revert if quality decreases

## üö® Important Notes

### Cost Management:
- OpenAI charges per API call
- Monitor usage at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- Generate in batches to optimize costs
- Review questions before bulk adding

### Quality Control:
- Always review AI-generated questions
- Check for accuracy and clarity
- Verify that correct answers are actually correct
- Ensure questions match your difficulty standards

### Privacy:
- Don't input sensitive or proprietary content
- Content is sent to OpenAI's servers
- Review OpenAI's data usage policies

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set
- Restart the server after setting the key
- Run `python setup_ai.py` for setup help

### "AI response was not valid JSON"
- System prompt may need adjustment
- Try simpler content or fewer questions
- Check OpenAI service status

### Poor Question Quality
- Refine your system prompt
- Provide clearer custom instructions
- Use higher quality input content
- Adjust difficulty preference

### Image Analysis Issues
- Ensure images contain readable text or clear diagrams
- Use PNG or JPEG formats
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 5MB)
- Provide context in custom instructions

## üéØ Advanced Tips

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with different instruction styles
2. **Content Preparation**: Clean up text before input for better results
